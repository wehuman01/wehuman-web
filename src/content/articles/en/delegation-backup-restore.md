The community-hub announcement had a table with one blunt row: subscription endpoints (base URL + API key) — the hub can keep them warm; local CLI accounts (`claude` / `codex` logins) — **no**. The reason was just as blunt: the login lives on your machine, and the server can't have it.

This update takes that row back. `awewarm config set <id> --remote` now works on Claude Code and Codex login accounts: your machine reads its own credentials (the macOS Keychain entry for Claude, `~/.codex/auth.json` for Codex), pushes them like an API key, and the server runs the CLI on your behalf. Your local login stays the single source of truth — every push and the background sync (at most twice an hour) re-read it, and a fingerprint mismatch re-pushes automatically. `status` shows the fingerprint too.

The trust model is unchanged: credentials live in the server's RAM only, never on disk. One addition — an account-wide login covers every subscription under it, so delegating one asks for an explicit confirmation naming the target server URL (`--yes` skips it in scripts).

## No CLI on the Server? Also Fine

Delegation used to require the matching CLI installed on the server box. That prerequisite is gone too: pushing to a machine without `claude` / `codex` no longer fails. The server records the connection as native mode and, at fire time, sends a plain HTTPS request — for Codex, a ChatGPT backend SSE request built from its OAuth tokens; for Claude, a POST carrying the accessToken. The push validates the credential offline first, so a delegation that is guaranteed to fail is rejected on the spot with the exact fix (run `claude /login` or `codex login` locally, then push again). Install the CLI on that box later and one re-push flips the connection back to CLI mode.

## New Machine: One Backup, One Restore

Pairing is machine-bound, and switching machines always meant re-pairing and asking the operator to free a slot. There is now a migration path:

```bash
awewarm config backup        # writes the archive, prints the path
# carry the file to the new machine (it holds plaintext keys — encrypt in transit)
awewarm config restore awewarm-backup.tar.gz
```

One tar.gz carries config, secrets, state, and the machine-id. Restore it on the new machine and the hub treats it as the same one — no new pairing slot, no operator involvement, schedule and keys pick up where they left off. Restore refuses to overwrite existing files without `--force`, and rejects archives holding unexpected members.

## Laptop Rarely Online: Opt-in Server-side Keys

By design, delegated keys live in the server's RAM only, and your machine re-pushes whenever it is online. The cost: if the server restarts while your machine is off, that machine's warm-ups wait until you come back. For machines that go online rarely, a connection can now opt into server-side storage (`keys.json`, plaintext, 0600) that survives restarts:

```bash
awewarm config set glm-sub --persist-key on
```

The option ships off by default, and we discourage it — a plaintext key on the server's disk widens the trust boundary from "the server's memory" to "the server's disk." So every step confirms: turning it on defaults to No, and turning it off tells you both consequences (the server deletes the key at once; a restart while you're offline holds warm-ups again). On a hub, the operator must also allow it first (`awewarm-hub config --persist-keys on`); a hub that hasn't rejects persisted pushes with a 403. `status` labels where each key lives, and taking a connection back purges its disk copy.

## You Say, awewarm Runs

| You say | awewarm runs |
|---|---|
| "My Claude Code login should stay warm on the server too." | `awewarm config set <id> --remote` |
| "I just re-logged in on my laptop." | `awewarm remote push` (or wait — the background sync re-pushes) |
| "I don't want a CLI on the server." | Just push — the connection runs over native HTTPS |
| "I'm switching to a new machine." | `awewarm config backup` → `awewarm config restore` on the new one |
| "This machine is offline for weeks at a time." | `awewarm config set <id> --persist-key on` |

One-line summary: delegation no longer picks connection types — from API keys to CLI logins, a whole machine's warm-ups can move to the server.

## Try It

### Let the agent install it

In Claude Code, Codex, or any coding agent, say:

```text
Read https://github.com/wehuman01/awewarm/blob/main/README.ai.md and follow it to install and configure awewarm.
```

### Or do it yourself

```bash
pip install awewarm

# CLI login accounts delegate the same way
awewarm config set claude-main --remote

# Machine migration
awewarm config backup

# Laptop rarely online? Optional
awewarm config set glm-sub --persist-key on
```
