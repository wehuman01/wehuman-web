Here is a fact that pricing pages never mention: every turn, a coding agent resends its entire history — full text, all of it. The grep from turn 3 sits untouched in the request at turn 30, and your provider bills for it twenty-seven more times.

awerouter already routes simple work to cheap models. But routing decides *where* tokens go — not *how many*. The same 80 KB build log gets billed over and over, even at the cheapest rate.

So we added RTK compression. Enable it per profile with `"rtk": true`, and long tool outputs — git diffs, grep hits, directory listings, build logs — get compressed in place before routing and before billing. Same session, a fraction of the tokens.

## Only Compress What It Should

RTK recognizes tool output by type — git diff, git status, git log, grep hits, directory trees, build logs, line-numbered file reads — and each type gets its own compression. The rules have to be picky, and one near-miss says why: a pattern meant for git-status porcelain matched any line with deep indentation, and a Claude Code file read came within one regex of being rewritten into a single "clean — nothing to commit" line. The matcher now remembers what git users take for granted: real porcelain never has both status slots blank.

The principle fits on one line: a missed compression only wastes savings; a wrong one destroys what the model needed to see.

## The Skeleton: Cut the Middle, Keep the Shape

The blunt way to shrink a 2000-line dump is head + tail, discard the middle. The model sees what the file starts with, how it ends, and a hole.

The update keeps a **skeleton** of that hole: up to 60 signature, import, and declaration lines survive from the truncated middle, deduped. So instead of a blind gap, the model sees the file's structure — and, crucially, *knows what it did not see*. When it actually needs a cut function, the marker tells it exactly where to look: `re-read with offset=N`.

Lossy compression with an escape hatch for the reader. That is the difference between summarizing a file and hiding it.

## Idempotency: Same History In, Same Bytes Out

This one sounds boring and is load-bearing. Tool results are resent every turn — which is exactly what prompt caching bills on. If compression produces even one byte of drift between passes, the provider's cache prefix breaks and you pay full price again, the exact thing compression was saving.

So RTK treats determinism as a hard requirement: identical history must compress to identical bytes, every turn. Compressed text carries uniform markers, and anything already carrying a marker is left alone; per-format line caps sit below the detection gates, so already-compacted output never re-enters compression. The cache prefix survives.

## Savings You Can See

RTK savings were logged from day one and shown nowhere. Now every usage view carries them: a shared header prints `rtk: saved N input tokens (x/y requests compressed)` when anything was compressed, per-request entries show `rtk=+N`, and the savings view adds an rtk block noting it stacks with flash offload — the router sends traffic to the cheap tier, and compression makes even that tier smaller.

Nothing prints when nothing was compressed. A feature that is off should look off.

## What It Looks Like

When RTK is on, you see it in three places.

Start-up banner:
```
awerouter listening on 127.0.0.1:8765  [default]
  protocol      -> anthropic
  rtk           -> on (tool-result compression)
```

Per-request stdout (only when something was actually compressed):
```
[rtk] saved 14230/45800 chars (31.1%) via [grep] hits=1
[rtk] saved 8400/12000 chars (70.0%) via [git-diff,smart-truncate] hits=2
```

`awerouter usage log` — header plus a tag on each row:
```
search discount: 30%  |  total: 12,400  |  search: 0
rtk: saved 700 input tokens (2/3 requests compressed)

2026-08-29T10:00:00  a1b2c3d4e5f6  anthropic  claude  flash  ...  tokens=4200  in=3800  rtk=+500
2026-08-29T10:01:00  f6e5d4c3b2a1  anthropic  claude  flash  ...  tokens=2100  in=1500
```

`awerouter usage savings` — an extra block at the bottom:
```
rtk compression (input trimmed before billing, stacks with flash offload):
  saved 700 input tokens across 2 requests
```

## The Contract: Fail Open, Opt Out, Recalibrate

- **Fail open**: compression is wrapped so that any internal error returns the original text. A compressor may under-save; it must never break a request.
- **Opt out**: any single request can skip compression with `X-Awerouter-Token-Saver: off`. Heuristics have limits; you keep the veto.
- **Recalibrate**: compressed requests change the token counts the long-context threshold reads, so after enabling rtk, run `usage calibrate` once. A threshold tuned on uncompressed traffic will over-trigger the pro tier.

RTK is experimental, which is why it ships off by default — without touching your config, nothing changes. It rewrites your tool output, and honesty about that is part of the design.

## Try It

### Let the agent install it

If you're in Claude Code, Codex, or any other coding agent, tell it:

```text
Read https://github.com/mugpeng/awerouter/blob/main/README.ai.md and follow it to install and configure awerouter.
```

### Or do it yourself

```bash
pip install awerouter

# In your profile, opt in:
#   { "rtk": true, ... }

# Then recalibrate thresholds on the compressed traffic
awerouter usage calibrate

# And watch what compression saves
awerouter usage savings
```

One-line summary: the router used to decide where your tokens go — now it can also decide how many of them there need to be.
